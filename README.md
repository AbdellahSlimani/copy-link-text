# Copy Link Text for Firefox

**Copy Link Text** is a Firefox extension designed to solve a common problem: easily copying the text of hyperlinks on a webpage. While many browsers offer this functionality on desktop, Firefox lacks it, particularly on mobile devices. This extension provides a fast, simple, and user-friendly solution.

## Key Features

- **Mobile-First Design:** Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile browsers, offering essential functionality for copying link text on mobile.
- **No Right-Click Required:** Uses a copy mode activated by clicking the extension icon, which works perfectly on mobile and desktop.
- **No Ads, No Data Collection:** Your privacy is a top priority. No tracking or ads, ensuring a secure and smooth experience.
- **Open-Source:** Fully open-source for inspection and contribution.
- **Simple and Intuitive:** Activate copy mode with a click and copy link text with a tap. Deactivate by clicking the icon again.

## Why It's Useful

- **Enhanced Mobile Experience:** Firefox on mobile lacks native support for copying link text, but Copy Link Text solves this issue.
- **Faster Workflow:** Quickly copy multiple link texts without extra steps.
- **Privacy-Focused:** No tracking, no adsâ€”just the functionality you need.

## How It Works

1. **Activate Copy Mode:** Click the extension icon to enable copy mode.
2. **Copy Link Text:** Tap any hyperlink on the page to copy the text to your clipboard.
